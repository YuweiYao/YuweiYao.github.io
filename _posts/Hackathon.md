We were assigned to group"Sunrun". Sunrun has grown from a small startup founded in 2007 to the largest residential solar provider in the U.S. with more than 220,000 customers in 23 states and Puerto Rico. Wheatâ€™s presence gave students insights into what it takes to launch a start-up and scale it up successfully.

Together as a team, Peter Li, Heidi Xiong and I dug deep into the data sets to produce a well-rounded presentation to capture first place in the Sunrun challenge.

We focused on crafting a coherent story that showed our understanding of the business, and solutions that were developed with their intentions in mind.
